                <p class="review-text">"Babycare was recommended to us through the concierge at our hotel. I called and scheduled a sitter over the phone and received prompt service and email confirmations. Our sitter, Jessica, was amazing! My kids loved her and were very comfortable with her right away. She was very professional and easy to work with, and quite obviously loved kids. My husband and I were able to relax and enjoy a couple evenings out on our recent vacation because we had such confidence in her ability to take care of the kids. We would absolutely use The Babysitting Company again and recommend them to other parents!"</p>
